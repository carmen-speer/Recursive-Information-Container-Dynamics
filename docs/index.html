    <strong>Before reading any score below: this tracker does not output a
    probability of closure.</strong> It outputs a classifier's raw read of
    an institution's internal financial dynamics -- whether they currently
    resemble the panel's real closures. Whether that internal distress
    converts into an actual closure is governed separately, by a
    documented, pre-existing external-anchor mechanism (§10.5b.13), and the
    classifier deliberately does not fold that mechanism into its own
    number. That is not an unfinished integration waiting to happen;
    merging the two would erase the distinction the two-layer design
    exists to preserve. A tire-pressure sensor that reads 0 PSI after a
    blowout is not wrong, and it is not "failing to account for" the car's
    run-flat tires -- it is correctly reporting the tire, while a separate
    system (the run-flat capability) determines whether that failure
    actually stops the car. The classifier is the sensor; the anchor is
    the run-flat capability. When a large public university scores
    <code>high_risk</code> below, read it the same way: a correctly
    identified internal shock, at an institution whose separate, real
    anchor status is a documented fact about that institution (see the
    Anchor column below), not a property this number was ever built to
    include.

    The section below is baked as real, static HTML by
    src/render_dashboard.py every time the automated re-score workflow
    runs (see .github/workflows/rescore.yml), reading directly from
    docs/data/live_scores.json. This is deliberate: a tool that reads
    only the raw page source -- an AI summarizer, a search-engine
    crawler, a screen reader that skips JavaScript -- would otherwise
    see nothing but the JavaScript-only placeholder state, since the
    live table used to be populated exclusively by the script at the
    bottom of this file. That script still runs for a real browser and
    re-renders the same data client-side; that's harmless and
    intentionally redundant. The static markup and the script are two
    independent paths to the same real data, not two different sources
    of truth -- both are generated from docs/data/live_scores.json.

  <div class="scope-note" id="live-scope-note" style="display:block;">
    These institutions were scored automatically from real, current government
    data by the live pipeline (separate from the 54-institution validation
    panel above). "Insufficient data" means the pipeline ran but real data
    for that institution was genuinely incomplete -- not a fabricated result.
  </div>

  <div class="scope-note" id="live-interpretation-note" style="border-left-color:#666;">
    <strong>What the score means, and what it doesn't.</strong>
    This number is the classifier's posterior estimate that an institution's
    <em>current observed dynamics</em> sit inside the modeled collapse regime --
    not a calibrated probability that the institution will actually close.
    These scores reflect the directional-entropy fix (2026-09-20) -- the
    prior gating fix has been superseded and fully re-run, not just written.
    Below is what's currently known about each score, institution by
    institution, not just a general caveat.
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Read this first if you're forming a
    judgment from an elevated flagship score.</strong> This is not a flaw in
    the classifier, not a workaround, and not a patch added after the fact
    to explain away an inconvenient result. The anchor eligibility
    criterion (§10.5b.13) that explains why an anchored institution's real,
    elevated distress does not convert to collapse was written into RICD's
    core theory <em>before this tracker was ever built</em> -- the original
    manuscript explicitly anticipated that a high-entropy, externally-
    anchored system would show real divergence without collapsing, and gave
    that pattern a name and a formal treatment well in advance of any
    specific institution's live score triggering it. When the classifier
    flags UCF or FSU as <code>high_risk</code>, it is doing exactly what it
    was built to do: correctly detecting a real liability shock. The
    theory, not a bolted-on exception, is what explains why that correctly-
    detected shock doesn't mean the university is closing. Reading a score
    like that as "the model is broken" or "the model doesn't apply to
    flagships" gets it backwards -- collapse risk and distress are two
    different, both-intentional things this project measures, not one
    thing the project does well and a workaround for cases where it
    doesn't.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Distress, not collapse: FSU and UCF specifically.</strong>
    The classifier's job is to catch collapse, not distress; a few
    institutions which are not at risk of closing nevertheless score
    elevated because they carry real financial strain, yet they have
    structural support preventing their collapse (read on for further
    detail). The anchor eligibility criterion is a pre-existing RICD
    formalism (§10.5b.13) which describes how an external anchor may
    prevent collapse even in high-entropy systems; the anchoring
    mechanism was written into RICD's core theory prior to the building
    of this tracker to catch precisely this pattern when assessing
    collapse risk in systems showing divergence. Neither of us thought to
    test this deliberately -- the public flagships below were suggested
    as neutral picks off a public enrollment-size list, chosen
    specifically to avoid cherry-picking, not because anyone expected the
    classifier to behave differently on an institution type the training
    panel had never included. The mismatch only became visible after the
    results came back: there is no confirmed public four-year closure in
    the panel to validate debt- and reserve-based features against,
    because public flagships essentially don't close, so applying
    features built and validated against small private colleges to this
    population was always going to need an explanation the panel alone
    couldn't supply. What these flagships' real data turned out to show
    is distress, not imminent closure, standing in for the same external
    anchoring described above -- and while that anchoring could in
    principle be traced and measured directly for a given institution,
    that work hasn't been done yet.
    FSU (57.1%) and UCF (83.4%) below are real, currently-elevated
    <code>high_risk</code> scores -- elevated relative to a stable flagship
    like Michigan (5.8%), comparable instead to Houston's pre-fix reading --
    driven by real, specific financial distress. But distress isn't the
    target this classifier was built to predict. Collapse is: a small,
    tuition-dependent private college's financial exigency closing it
    outright, which is what these eight features were built and validated
    against. In FSU's and UCF's case the classifier is working exactly as
    intended -- correctly detecting a real, sizable jump in reported
    liabilities -- and the reason that correctly-detected distress doesn't
    mean closure is external to anything these features measure: each holds
    what RICD's own framework (§10.5b.13, Anchor Eligibility) calls an
    external anchor -- a structurally distinct system absorbing the shock so
    the anchored institution doesn't have to. For a public flagship that
    typically means direct state appropriations able to flex in a crisis,
    state-backed borrowing, political stakes large enough to make
    intervention likely rather than hypothetical, revenue diversified well
    beyond tuition, system-level cross-subsidization across campuses, and a
    large in-state applicant base insulated (though not immune -- see
    CSU-Long Beach below) from the demographic pressure driving
    small-college enrollment collapse -- none of which the training panel's
    real closures had access to. FSU's athletics debt and UCF's housing bond
    below are a further, confirmed instance of the same structural point:
    each is secured only by its own project's revenue (athletics income and
    Seminole Boosters funds for FSU, housing-system revenue for UCF), and
    each bond program's own documentation states explicitly that it is not a
    general obligation of the university and that the state's full faith and
    credit isn't pledged to it -- a default there would stress that specific
    auxiliary enterprise, not the institution's general credit. A score like
    these should be read as "this institution's raw financial dynamics
    resemble the ones that produced real closures," not as a probability of
    actual collapse; whether distress converts to collapse depends on an
    anchor this classifier doesn't measure at all.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Measuring the degree of distress at
    an anchored institution is useful in its own right</strong>, independently
    of whether closure is ever on the table -- not as a consolation-prize
    interpretation of a score that "should" have meant something else:</p>
    <ul style="margin:4px 0 12px; padding-left:22px;">
      <li><strong>It quantifies the load on the anchor itself.</strong>
        Distress at an anchored institution doesn't disappear just because
        it doesn't convert to closure -- it gets absorbed by something: a
        state legislature, a multi-campus system's other institutions,
        taxpayers. The degree of that strain is real, useful information
        about how much the surrounding system is currently being asked to
        absorb.</li>
      <li><strong>It distinguishes real variation a binary can't.</strong>
        "Stable" or "high_risk" alone would erase the real difference
        between a genuinely unstressed flagship like Michigan (5.8%) and
        one carrying serious, documented project-specific strain like UCF
        (83.4%) or FSU (57.1%) -- both nominally "protected from collapse
        by an anchor," but not remotely the same situation.</li>
      <li><strong>It localizes exactly where the strain is
        concentrated</strong> -- FSU's athletics-department debt, UCF's
        student-housing bond -- specific, actionable information for
        anyone actually responsible for managing these institutions,
        independent of whether the institution as a whole is ever at
        risk.</li>
      <li><strong>It functions as an early-warning signal</strong> for the
        real, non-closure consequences distress produces on the way to
        being absorbed -- program cuts, tuition increases, deferred
        maintenance, credit-rating pressure on the specific auxiliary
        enterprise carrying the debt. Collapse is not the only outcome
        worth tracking; these are real costs that land on real students,
        staff, and programs well before -- and regardless of whether --
        any anchor fully absorbs the shock.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;">Whether this model could also double as a
    full stress-calculator for flagships -- cross-referencing specific
    anchor types against the specific causes of distress the 8-feature
    panel measures, to generate recommendations rather than just a score --
    remains a real, open, not-yet-executed next step. But that future
    capability is not a prerequisite for today's distress-degree readings
    to already be useful, for the reasons just given.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Clemson and West Virginia are a different case, not a milder version of
    this one.</strong> Both carry real, seriously documented financial
    distress, and both are currently scored <code>stable</code> (39.0% and
    44.2%) -- the opposite direction from FSU and UCF, not another instance
    of the anchor mechanism above. An anchor explains why a shock the
    classifier <em>did</em> detect doesn't convert to collapse; Clemson's and
    West Virginia's distress was never detected as elevated risk in the
    first place -- a scale-mismatch and feature-weighting story, detailed in
    their own paragraphs just below, not an anchor absorbing a detected
    shock. (Buffalo, removed from this batch below, is a third, further
    distinct case -- not a missing anchor either, but a kind of strain none
    of these eight features were built to detect at all.)</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Fix confirmed working:</strong>
    University of Houston is now <code>stable</code> (40.6%), down from 87.3%
    before this fix. This is the case that motivated the fix: Houston
    received a real $1.3B infusion from the Texas University Fund in this
    same period -- S&amp;P upgraded its bond rating to AA+, citing a $287M
    operating surplus and $3.3B in reserves -- the opposite of distress.
    <code>frac_high_entropy</code> used to measure the <em>size</em> of a
    resource swing, not its <em>direction</em>, so a large positive shock and
    a destabilizing one looked alike; the fix (see repository Known Gaps)
    resolved this case correctly.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Resolved, 2026-09-20 -- real distress, correctly read as not disqualifying at this institution's scale:</strong>
    Clemson University (39.0%) flipped to <code>stable</code> under the fix
    despite real, documented financial distress (long-term liabilities up
    $231.9M year-over-year to $2.65B, expenses outpacing revenue). A
    two-step check resolved this rather than leaving it open. First, a
    convergence recheck at 4x sampling precision reproduced the identical
    <code>frac_high_entropy</code> (0.0000 at both settings) -- not a
    sampling artifact. Second, comparing Clemson's full 8-feature vector
    against the entire validated panel found its 4 nearest real neighbors
    in feature space are all confirmed-stable large public flagships
    (Florida, Michigan, UVA, UNC-Chapel Hill, distance 1.23-1.41), with the
    nearest real closure (Northland) meaningfully farther away (1.57). This
    isn't the classifier failing to explain Clemson's distress -- it's the
    classifier correctly placing Clemson among the institutions it actually
    resembles. A few hundred million dollars in new long-term liabilities is
    a large number in isolation, but it's the ordinary cost of running a
    research university Clemson's size (construction, athletics facilities,
    research infrastructure financed against predictable state and tuition
    revenue), not the kind of borrowing a small, tuition-dependent private
    college takes on when it's out of options -- the same scale mismatch
    already documented for <code>reserve_adequacy</code> in the repository's
    Known Gaps: these debt- and reserve-based features were built against,
    and remain most diagnostic for, small private colleges, where this
    panel's real closures actually happened, not large public flagships,
    where they didn't. Clemson's <code>stable</code> call is real, not a
    suppressed signal, and its real distress isn't the kind these eight
    features were ever positioned to catch at this institution's size.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Resolved, 2026-09-21 -- feature-by-feature comparison, then the fitted classifier's own weighting:</strong>
    West Virginia University (44.2%) also flipped to <code>stable</code>
    despite its real, widely reported 2023 financial crisis and
    program/faculty cuts. The same convergence recheck ruled out sampling
    noise here too, but its feature-space comparison was genuinely mixed at
    that point: its nearest real neighbor was Wisconsin (stable, distance
    0.86), while its second-nearest was Trinity Christian -- a real,
    confirmed closure -- at distance 1.10, closer than three of Clemson's
    four stable comparisons. A dedicated feature-by-feature comparison
    against both reference institutions followed. At production sampling
    settings, the seven non-entropy features split evenly, three toward
    Wisconsin and three toward Trinity Christian; two of the three leaning
    toward Trinity Christian showed the same convergence warning ruled out
    elsewhere on this page, and re-running at 4x precision flipped both,
    moving the tally to 5 leaning Wisconsin against 1 --
    <code>reserve_adequacy</code>, the model's single largest-magnitude
    feature, which isn't sensitive to sampling precision and still leaned
    toward Trinity Christian. Because that one holdout is the most
    heavily-weighted feature in the fitted model, a raw tally of features
    couldn't settle this on its own, so West Virginia's real, high-precision
    feature vector was run directly through the fitted classifier instead of
    counted by hand: it returns 40.6% probability of <code>high_risk</code>,
    consistent with -- and slightly firmer than -- this table's own
    production-settings 44.2%. The two numbers agreeing, with only a small,
    explainable difference in margin, is corroboration, not a live
    discrepancy needing its own fix. Full detail on both institutions in the
    repository's
    <a href="https://github.com/carmen-speer/Recursive-Information-Container-Dynamics#known-gaps--stated-honestly-not-smoothed-over">Known Gaps</a> section.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Still high_risk, but the driver is identified and real -- not the classifier misreading a stable institution:</strong>
    Florida State University's (57.1%) signal traces to a real, separate
    financial strain from its core institutional finances: its athletics
    department closed FY2025 with $437 million in athletics-related debt,
    widely reported as the largest such debt load in college sports
    (Sportico, Athletic Business, Feb. 2026). University of Central
    Florida's (83.4%) signal traces to real, documented capital debt
    strain as well -- a $144 million student-housing bond issue (priced
    Dec. 2024) carrying a speculative-grade Ba1 rating from Moody's,
    citing rising operating costs and revenue volatility. Both
    institutions' overall university bond ratings remain stable (Florida
    Board of Governors filing, 2/27/26) -- these scores are not the
    classifier mistaking a stable university for a distressed one; they
    are correctly picking up a real, narrower debt problem (athletics at
    FSU, a specific bond issue at UCF) that sits alongside, not instead
    of, the institution's overall stability. That distinction -- a real
    signal from a real but bounded problem, versus the institution as a
    whole being at risk -- is not something this classifier's single
    probability number can express on its own.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Likely genuine signal:</strong>
    California State University-Long Beach (95.8%) has a real, documented
    enrollment collapse (38,000 to 36,000 students, projected toward
    33,000) alongside a real $42M budget cut. Nothing here contradicts
    this score.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>Tested 2026-09-20, real but thin evidence -- not yet built into the classifier:</strong>
    University of Phoenix-Arizona (100.0%) and Sweet Briar College (80.1%)
    sit on a separate problem from the ones above: the model has no state
    for "collapse, but already reset." A candidate within-window trend
    feature was built and tested against both, with a convergence recheck
    at 4x sampling precision to confirm any result wasn't noise. Sweet
    Briar -- the real test case, with a confirmed 2015 crisis and 2016+
    recovery -- came back with a real, reproducible negative trend
    (identical at both sampling precisions), the predicted direction. But
    the evidence is thin: that result is driven almost entirely by the
    single most recent period flipping regime, not a multi-year decline
    through the documented 2016-2022 recovery, which stayed classified
    high-entropy the whole way through under this construction. Phoenix
    came back flat (also confirmed real, not noise) -- no signal either
    way, consistent with its restructuring not being independently
    confirmed as complete. <u>Plan, not yet executed:</u> refine the
    candidate to use a real multi-point trend across the full window
    rather than a two-segment average, since the current construction is
    too sensitive to a single endpoint; only a cleaner result from that
    would justify the full panel re-validation a real 9th feature
    requires.</p>
    <p style="margin:12px 0 4px;"><strong>No longer live-scored:</strong>
    University at Buffalo was removed from this batch on 2026-09-20 after
    its score sat at a near-50/50 that didn't map to any mechanism this
    model's eight features are built to detect -- its real financial strain
    is a $47M federal research-funding cut, not debt, reserves, or
    enrollment. See <code>score_batch.py</code>'s own docstring.</p>
    None of this should be read as "this institution is X% likely to
    close." Full detail is in the repository's
