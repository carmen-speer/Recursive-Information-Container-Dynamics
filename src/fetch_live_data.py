"""
Fetches real, current data for a given institution (by UNITID) to
support live scoring, rather than relying on the locally-downloaded
files used to build the original 54-institution validation panel.

Honest scope note: not everything here is fully automatable yet.

- Enrollment, completion, and admissions data: fully automated via the
  real, stable College Scorecard API (api.data.gov/ed/collegescorecard).
  Requires a free API key (get one at https://api.data.gov/signup/)
  set as the COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY environment variable.

- IPEDS finance, debt, and endowment data: NOT available through a
  clean, stable REST API -- NCES distributes it as downloadable data
  files instead. The exact download mechanism has changed more than
  once during this project: a defunct static zip pattern, then a
  defunct "data-generator" query-string endpoint (confirmed dead via
  a live GitHub Actions run on 2026-09-15 -- every single fiscal year
  returned a 404). A same-day diagnostic run against NCES's own live
  Data Center page found the real, current mechanism: NCES now serves
  each complete data file as a plain static ZIP archive at
  https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/complete-data-files/<table_name>.zip --
  no session, login, or query parameters required at all, a genuinely
  simpler system than any previous version of this function assumed.
  This was confirmed directly from real link text scraped off NCES's
  own live page, not guessed.

  This module downloads the most recent available bulk finance file
  it can find using that real, current pattern, but NCES has changed
  this mechanism multiple times before and may again -- this part of
  the pipeline should be monitored (see the GitHub Actions workflow's
  results), not trusted blindly forever.

# F3 form's published survey materials could not be pinned down (it's
# been revised more than once, and the specific package covering
# degree-granting for-profit institutions couldn't be located through
# NCES's own published materials).
#
# total_liabilities, revenue, and expenses are arithmetically PROVEN
# from that real row, not just plausible:
#   F3A01 (618,567,995) == F3A02 (378,890,323) + F3A03 (239,677,672)
#     -- the balance-sheet identity assets = equity + liabilities,
#     exact to the dollar, which is what confirms F3A03 as total
#     liabilities and F3A01/F3A02 as total assets/equity.
#   F3D01 (832,032,699) + F3D05 (8,651,564) + F3D08 (9,441,821)
#     == F3D09 (850,126,084) exactly -- confirms F3D09 as total revenue.
#   F3D09 (850,126,084) - F3B02 (761,327,216) == F3G01 (88,798,868)
#     exactly, and F3G01 is a real, standalone "net income" line --
#     confirms F3B02 as total expenses.
#
# institutional_support and instruction are NOT arithmetically proven
# the same way -- they're a strong but unverified structural inference:
# F3 and F2 are both FASB-standard forms (unlike the GASB-based F1),
# and F2's confirmed codes for these same two categories sit at the
# identical line positions (F2E061 = institutional support, F2E011 =
# instruction). If a future re-check finds these wrong, the pipeline
# fails safe either way -- see parse_live_finance()'s per-field
# try/except, which yields an honest "insufficient_data" on a bad
# field code rather than a silently wrong number, exactly like it did
# before this fix.

    runs against NCES's own Data Center pages on 2026-09-15 (run from
    GitHub Actions, which can actually reach nces.ed.gov -- this
    project's sandboxed development environments cannot).

    NCES actually splits this across two real, live addresses, by how
    recent the year is, not one:

    1. The newest year or two: a plain static ZIP with no session
       needed, at https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/complete-data-files/
       <table_name>.zip -- confirmed via real link text scraped
       directly off NCES's own live page for FY2022-23
       (.../complete-data-files/F2223_F1A.zip).
    2. Older years: NOT retired, but served from a second real
       address, https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/data/
       <table_name>.zip -- confirmed via real link text scraped off
       NCES's own live page for FY2017-18, AND independently confirmed
       with a direct, successful (HTTP 200) request for FY2018-19's
       table at that exact address. This is the same URL pattern an
       earlier revision of this function marked "defunct" -- it either
       came back, or the earlier failure was caused by something else
       (a wrong table-name construction, a missing session) rather
       than the address itself being gone; today's live, direct test
       is the real evidence, not that earlier assumption.

    This function tries address 1 first (correct for the newest
    years), and automatically falls back to address 2 if that 404s --
    so it keeps working as years roll from "newest" into "older"
    without needing a hardcoded cutoff year that would itself go stale.

    The downloaded file is a real ZIP archive (not a raw CSV) containing
    the actual data CSV alongside other files (dictionaries,
    revised-value flags); this function extracts the first real .csv
    file found inside it.

    Returns the local path (dest_dir/<year>/) on success, containing
    the extracted CSV file, or None if both real addresses genuinely
    fail (an honest failure, not a silent one -- callers should check
    for None and alert rather than assume success).
