Real adapter for RICD-BSSM: maps actual College Scorecard fields (via the
Rdatasets GitHub mirror of the U.S. Dept. of Education's public dataset)
to RICD's O_o, O_p, P_m channels, replacing the synthetic v0.1 adapter.

STAGE 2 UPDATE: adds real institutional finance data (revenue,
institutional-support/administrative spending, instructional spending,
net tuition), pulled from seven verified IPEDS Finance survey years
(2006-07, 2009-10, 2011-12, 2015-16, 2017-18, 2020-21, 2023-24) for six
private-nonprofit (FASB/F2-reporting) institutions, and wires E_exch,
M_maint, and W_adaptive to it. Verified against each year's actual data
dictionary, not assumed to carry over -- all five underlying variable
codes (F2B01, F2B02, F2E061, F2E011, F2D01) held identical meaning
across all seven years and 17 years span, confirmed directly.

CONCRETE MAPPING DECISIONS, STAGE 1 (superseded, kept for history):
O_p = completion rate. O_o = sticker tuition, normalized. P_m proxy WAS
admissions-rate trend, explicitly flagged at the time as not the real
construction.

STAGE 4 UPDATE: P_m proxy replaced. Primary proxy is now 1 - part-time
instructional staff share, drawn from real IPEDS HR data where
available (2013/2017/2023) -- a principled connection to genuine
self-monitoring capacity (job security enabling honest internal
dissent), not an arbitrary substitute the way admissions-rate trend
always was. Admissions-rate trend is retained only as a fallback for
years/institutions without HR data. External Governance Attestation
(RICD Definition 6.1.1 -- real AAUP censure/sanction or accreditor
action) is applied as a separate, direct override per
apply_governance_attestation() below, never blended into the
continuous proxy as one more weighted input.

CONCRETE MAPPING DECISIONS, STAGE 2 (new):
E_exch (resource inflow) = F2B01, total revenues and investment return.
M_maint (maintenance/administrative burden) = F2E061, institutional
support -- this is the genuine real-world counterpart to RICD's
maintenance-first priority convention, not a proxy for it.
W_adaptive candidate = F2E011, instruction spending -- money actually
reaching the core academic mission, distinct from administrative
overhead.
Net tuition = F2D01, confirmed net of discounts/allowances in every
year's dictionary description, not just the variable label.

Finance data is SPARSE relative to the annual enrollment/completion
panel: only 7 of 18 possible years are directly observed. This is
handled as a genuine sparse-observation problem in the state-space
model (model.py), not by interpolating fake intermediate values here --
R(t) and S(t) are latent, continuously-evolving states that the model
infers throughout, tied to real data only at the 7 years it actually
exists.

    Primary proxy, where HR data exists: 1 - part_time_share. Tenured

    structurally less able to serve as an honest self-monitoring

    meant to represent, not an arbitrary substitute the way raw
