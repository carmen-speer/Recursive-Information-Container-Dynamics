"""
One-time diagnostic, not part of the real pipeline. Purpose: get real,
current ground truth on how nces.ed.gov's Data Center actually serves
file downloads right now, since the previously-working data-generator
URL pattern started returning 404 for every year (confirmed directly
in this project's own GitHub Actions run on 2026-09-15) and this
project's sandboxed development environments cannot reach nces.ed.gov
at all to investigate directly -- only GitHub Actions' own runners can.

This script does not guess a new URL pattern. It requests the real
Data Center entry page with a persistent session (so cookies carry
across any redirects, unlike a one-off request), and prints back
enough of what it actually got -- final URL, status, and any real
download-looking links found in the page -- to build the next real fix
from actual evidence, rather than a fourth guess.
