Item 6, continued: tests the non-centered reparameterization of
W_instr_latent (model_variant_noncentered_w_instr.py) against Thomas
Aquinas College (UNITID 124292), directly comparable to
diagnose_sigma_fin_split.py's own log -- same institution, same
settings, same two-independent-runs structure. That prior run's real
result: sigma_fin_instr=1.0983 (worst parameter in the whole model),
W_instr_latent=1.0605, essentially unchanged from the pre-split value
(1.0639). diagnose_sigma_fin_instr_funnel.py's follow-up found
sigma_fin_instr has the strongest sigma/latent-path-variance correlation
of all four channels (0.587) -- real, if partial, evidence of a funnel
geometry specific to this channel. This script tests the concrete fix
that finding points to: the same non-centered reparameterization
already proven for z_raw/xi_scale elsewhere in this model, applied to
W_instr_latent.

Method: monkey-patches model.build_model_stage2 to
model_variant_noncentered_w_instr.build_model_stage2_noncentered_w_instr
for this process only, exactly as diagnose_sigma_fin_split.py already
did for its own variant. Neither model.py on disk nor the live scoring
pipeline is touched.

What confirms or rejects: if W_instr_latent's rhat (and sigma_fin_instr's)
drops meaningfully toward 1.0 relative to diagnose_sigma_fin_split.py's
1.0605/1.0983, that's real, direct confirmation the funnel geometry was
the actual cause and the fix works -- and the same reparameterization
should then be considered for model.py's real build_model_stage2 (a
production change, to be confirmed with Carmen first per CLAUDE.md,
same as any other consequential edit). If it doesn't move, or moves only
slightly, report that plainly -- this diagnostic-driven approach has
already surfaced two real, useful negative results in this investigation
(the volatility hypothesis, the posterior-magnitude-alone hypothesis),
and a third one would still be real progress, not a wasted step.
