# Instructions for any Claude session working on this repository

Read this before touching any file in this repository, whether you're a
chat session Carmen is talking to directly or the `@claude` GitHub Action
responding to a mention on an issue or PR.

## origin/main is the only ground truth

No Claude chat session working on this repository from Anthropic's cloud
sandbox has push access to GitHub. The only way a change reaches this
repository is either (a) Carmen pasting file content into GitHub's own
web editor herself, or (b) the `@claude` GitHub Action, which runs
directly against the live repository and can commit for real.

A chat session's local working copy of this repo is a snapshot from
whenever it was cloned or last synced. It goes stale the moment Carmen
pastes anything directly into GitHub, or a workflow run commits anything
(the scheduled `rescore.yml` run, a diagnostic workflow, a manual edit) --
and she does both of those independently of any given chat, on her own
schedule, without that chat knowing. So a local working copy can only
ever be *behind* `origin/main`, never ahead of it in any way that matters.

**Before claiming any file needs to be created, fixed, or pasted into
GitHub, run:**

```
git fetch origin
git diff origin/main -- <path>
```

If the file is already identical (or origin's version is newer/more
complete than the local copy), say so plainly and don't ask Carmen to do
anything. Never tell her a file "still needs to be pasted" without having
just run this check. Getting this wrong wastes her time and her usage
limit re-doing work she's already done.

## Formatting file content for chat pasting

When giving Carmen a file's full content to paste into GitHub's web
editor, check whether the file itself contains fenced code blocks
(sequences of 3+ backticks) before wrapping the whole thing in a fence of
your own. If it does, your wrapping fence needs *more* backticks than the
longest run inside the file, or the file's own internal fence will close
your wrapper early and the message will render as broken, mixed
plain-text/code-block garbage. When in doubt, check first:

```
grep -c '```' <file>
```

## How Carmen works, and what she needs from you

- She has no coding or GitHub background and isn't trying to build one on
  purpose -- she's picking it up incidentally as a side effect of this
  project moving fast. Explain steps plainly. Never assume she knows a
  git or GitHub term.
- For any file she needs to change: give the exact target URL and the
  complete file content in the chat, never a snippet or a single line to
  edit herself.
- She commits fast, via GitHub's one-click "copy all," without reading
  the pasted content herself first. If you're asking her to commit
  several files and separately telling her to run a specific workflow,
  state the file count and name the workflow by its literal filename,
  as two distinct, unambiguous instructions -- never phrased so it reads
  like all of them are workflows to run.
- Before executing a concrete, consequential edit to shared/public-facing
  material (this README, the live dashboard, anything already public),
  confirm the specific plan with her first, even under general standing
  direction to keep working. Routine continuation of already-agreed work
  doesn't need to stall on this.
